        you marketing communications from us if (i) you made a purchase or asked
        for information from us about our goods or services or (ii) you agreed

        out of receiving such communications since. Under these regulations, if
        you are a limited company, we may send you marketing emails without your
        consent. However you can still opt out of receiving marketing emails
        from us at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not share your personal data with any third party for their own
        marketing purposes without your express consent.

          info@superior-solar.co.uk</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you opt out of receiving marketing communications this opt-out does
        not apply to personal data provided as a result of other transactions,
        such as purchases, warranty registrations etc.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>5. Disclosures of your personal information</h3>
      <p>We may have to share your personal information with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and
          insurers
        </li>
        <li>
          Government bodies that require us to report processing activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our
          business or our assets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect
        the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with
        the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data
        for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>6. International Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always
        offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European
        law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless
        the transfer meets certain criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the
        European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data
        will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best
        to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one
        of the following safeguards is in place:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the
          European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of
          protection for personal data by; or
        </li>
        <li>
          Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts
          or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the
          European Commission which give personal data the same protection it
          has in Europe; or
        </li>
        <li>
          If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we
          may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in
          place.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your
        explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to
        withdraw this consent at any time.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        We have put in place security measures to prevent your personal data
        from being accidentally lost, used, altered, disclosed, or accessed
        without authorisation. We also allow access to your personal data only
        to those employees and partners who have a business need to know such
        data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and
        they must keep it confidential.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>8. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
        fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
        satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>9. Your Legal Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Under data protection laws you have rights in relation to your personal
        data that include: the right to request access, correction, erasure,
        restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data

          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.
